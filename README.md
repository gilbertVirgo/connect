# connect
Connect lonely people with local church communities

This may have already been done. Please let me know if it has, since I'd rather support something that is already on its feet.

<h2>Basic flow of usage</h2>
1. User is prompted with a small form (first name, last name, email, phone, postcode and needs).
2. This then does a search on local churches and offers to “connect” the user to the nearest one.
-- If the user would rather see a few options, perhaps 10 of the closest are provided.
3. When a user is “connected” to a church, that church’s administrator will receive an email/SMS message to prompt them to get in touch with the user. The administrator will also receive their contact details and needs (provided in the form).
